# Welcome to My Quartz Site

Welcome to my Quartz-powered website! Quartz allows you to build beautiful static sites from Markdown files. Below, you’ll find some sample content and images. You can click on the images to see them in their full size.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Quartz, check out the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) to learn how to customize your site and add content.

## Sample Content

Here's some sample content to demonstrate how Quartz works with Markdown.

### Section 1: Markdown Basics

You can use regular Markdown syntax in Quartz to format your content. For example:

- **Bold Text**: `**Bold Text**`
- _Italic Text_: `*Italic Text*`
- [Links](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz): `[Links](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)`

You can also add headings, lists, and other typical Markdown elements to your pages.

### Section 2: Image Embedding

Now let's test the image embedding feature where images are clickable and link to their original size.

#### Example 1: Small Image with Link

Below is a small image embedded at 250 pixels wide. Click on the image to view the full-size version.

#### Example 2: Medium Image with Link

Here’s a medium-sized image embedded at 500 pixels wide. You can click it to see the full-size version.

![Example Image|800](https://images.alphacoders.com/100/1007350.jpg)

#### Example 3: Large Image with Link

Finally, here’s a large image embedded at 800 pixels wide. Clicking on it will show the full-resolution version.

## Conclusion

This is a basic Quartz page with text, images, and links. Feel free to customize it further by adding your own content, styles, and configurations.
